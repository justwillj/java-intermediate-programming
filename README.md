## Testing

There are a number of unit test that have been written to test the implementation of each method.

To run test for each of the methods:
1. There will be a folder named test/java which will have another folder io.catalyte.training
2. Open the LogicProblemslmplTest and you will be about to right-click or click the green arrow by the method you wish to test. For example averageGoodTest is testing the average method.
3. Once you run the test at the bottom a dialog should appear and indicate if the test passed or not.
4. If you wish to run all the test at once you can right-click on the LogicProblemsImplTest or click the green arrow by it.
